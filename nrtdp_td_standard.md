Myoglobin | M5696 | Sigma Aldrich
Carbonic Anhydrase | C2624 | Sigma Aldrich
Optima Grade Water | W6-4 | Fisher Scientific

### Important notes

- Use 1.5 mL Eppendorf LoBind microcentrifuge tubes for protein stock preparation, top-down (TD) standard preparation, and long term aliquot storage. In our experience, these tubes have shown the lowest degree of plasticizer leaching and/or protein binding during use and storage.
- Approximate final protein amounts (loaded on-column): 0.1 pmol ubiquitin, 0.5 pmol trypsinogen, 1 pmol myoglobin, and 0.6 pmol carbonic anhydrase. Superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is present as a contaminant in carbonic anhydrase.
- A TD standard prepared in this way should be stable for up to three days at 4 °C (before significant protein oxidation becomes evident).

## Recipe

- Prepare 2 mg/mL stocks of each protein standard in Optima H2O. (Aliquots can be stored at -80 °C.)
- Prepare the following (volumes shown from respective stock solutions):

Protein  | Volume (µL) | Stock Concentration (pmol/µL) | Amount Loaded on Column (pmol, 1X)
---------|-------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------
Carbonic Anhydrase | 40 | 25.7 | 0.64
Myoglobin | 40 | 43.9 | 1.09
Trypsinogen | 25 | 19.6 | 0.49
Ubiquitin | 2.5 | 5.5 | 0.14
Total | 107.5 | |

- Divide final mixture into 2.5 uL aliquots and store at -80 °C
